This weeks task besides working in pairs and branches (I decided to do solo due to turn of events), was to:
✓ Get in to basic JSON

✓ How to use `fetch()` in JavaScript

✓ How to use promises in JavaScript

✓ How to work with the `Date()` object in JavaScript


* Problems:
From being in pairs to ending up solo due to my partner needing to change directions privately, I decided to do the project solo.
I found it very challenging to find structure for this project. The new methods to take in when the previous week was a lot to take in about JavaScript, I felt that understanding all these terms requires a lot of more time than provided, or so I felt. 
I did manage to create through youtube, former students and google a design I am proud of and that fits my creative mind. So that's always something.

The biggest challenge is not having enough time and discussion to fully grasp basic JS. Digging in to JSON and using fetch-method was not possible without help from classmates and this project wouldn't have come to a stretch-mark level without help from comrades. 


* I do like my dynamic background which changes every time the browser updates, have a look:
